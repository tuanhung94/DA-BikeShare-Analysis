# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program - Project 02 : US Bike Share Analysis
## Introduction
In this project, we are going to examine data of bikeshare activities in three major US cities: New York City, Chicago and Washington. Throughout our report, we will identify what questions could be answered from analyzing our datasets, how the patterns of bike-sharing activities in these 3 cities relate as well as compare to one another. Let's find out!
### Part 1: Data Collection and Wrangling
- We kick-start our project by assessing and printing out some samples from our dataset to have a clearer understanding of what we are working on, then lay out what directions to take to achieve our defined goals. 
- Data from three cities are properly cleaned and condensed to only necessary information required to answer our questions.
### Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Compute descriptive statistics from our datasets by creating some helper functions to address our inquiries and reveal some interesting insights regarding bike-sharing activities.
- Use matplotlib library to visualize and dig deeper into our findings, such as the distribution of trip durations for different types of customers.
### Part 3: Perform Independent Analysis
- In this last section, we will continue our investigation by raising more questions, then further explore our dataset and make full use of data analysis as well as visualization techniques to complete this project in a detailed and scientific manner.
